"""Exercise 3.10 – Intro to Object Oriented Programming"""

"""1. What is the difference between a local variable and an object’s
attribute?"""

#object attributes define the object and how it works. the type, the methods
#in the objects etc etc. Everything that is fundamental to an object
# is an attribute. Local variables are a piece of the puzzle that
# makes the code function, but can be changed, and is not necessarily
# a building block like atributes.
# attributes = ten ingredients that make the batter for the cake
# local variables = whether the cake has m&ms on it or sprinkles
"""2. What method is called when the object is created?"""

#__init__

"""3. If you have an object instance, obj, and you want to call its do
something() method (assuming it has one),
how would you do this? (write the line of code you would use)"""
#obj.dosomething()
